# F = MA Calculator Using Python

A PBL (Project Based Learning) project to understand Newton's Laws of Motion,
in particular the F = MA equation by creating a python module that can solve for X given 2 parameters
in the F = MA equation.

# Getting Started
- clone the repository
- run the calculator using the command line
```
python3 fma.py <force> <mass> <acceleration>
```

## Verify Math
```py
python3 fma.py 10 5 2
# >>> force: 10.0, mass: 5.0, acceleration: 2.0  is correct!
```
## Solve for X
```py
python3 fma.py 10 5 None
# >>> force: 10.0, mass: 5.0, acceleration: 2.0
```
